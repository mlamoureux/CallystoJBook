# Callysto’s Partners

Callysto is the creation of two not-for-profit organizations dedicated to driving digital education and infrastructure:

**Cybera** is a not-for-profit technology-neutral organization responsible for driving Alberta’s economic growth through the use of digital technology. Its core role is to oversee the development and operations of Alberta’s cyberinfrastructure – the advanced system of networks and computers that keeps government, educational institutions, not-for-profits, business incubators, and entrepreneurs at the forefront of technological change.

**The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)** is a collaborative network dedicated to the promotion of discovery, understanding and awareness in the mathematical sciences. PIMS brings together leading researchers from major Universities across western Canada, as well as the University of Washington, and is a Unité Mixte Internationale of the National Center for Scientific Research (Le Centre national de la recherche scientifique, CNRS).


The CanCode program, managed by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, will invest $50 million over two years, starting in 2017-18, to support initiatives providing educational opportunities for coding and digital skills development to Canadian youth from kindergarten to grade 12 (K-12). It also supports initiatives that provide K-12 teachers with the training and professional development they need to introduce digital skills, coding and related concepts into the classroom.
