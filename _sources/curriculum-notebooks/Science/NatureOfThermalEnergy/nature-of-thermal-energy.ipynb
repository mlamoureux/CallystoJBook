Think of the particles in a solid. As they gain more heat energy, the particles themselves gain more kinetic energy.

Eventually the bonds that hold the solid together cannot maintain the amount of collisions and the solid begins to break apart, into a liquid. This is known as melting. \n", "\n", "Once the matter has melted, the particles begin to flow, yet they still maintain a bit of their structure; they are still \"connected\". If you were to give them even more heat energy, the structure begins to fall apart, and eventually the matter becomes a gas where the particles can move around freely and disperse from one another. This process is called evaporation. \n", "\n", "Some of the main characteristics of a substance are the temperatures at which these transitions happen. These are known as the *melting point* and *boiling point* of the substance.

The acronym SATP stands for Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure, and is used as a standard ruler for experimental measurements. The melting and boiling points of water change at different pressures and therefore the pressure at which these quanitities were measured must be specified as well.

Convection\n", "\n", "Heat transfer via **convection** occurs due to the movement of molecules in a fluid (gas or liquid). Convection is perhaps the most intuitive method of heat transfer. Since it involves the flow of a gas or liquid from a warmer to a colder temperature within the fluid, it is easy to visualize. Convection does not occur in solid materials because the molecules that make up a solid do not have the ability to flow; this is what makes a solid a solid. Not unlike conduction, convection occurs from the flow of heat energy due a temperature difference within a fluid. The hotter fluid flows to regions where the fluid is cooler. It is the process which governs the currents in our oceans and the movement of air in our atmosphere. Our understanding of convection has helped us forecast the weather and even explain how energy is transported within the sun!\n", "\n", "---\n", "**Why does the movement occur?**\n", "\n", "If we consider the particle model of matter, the fluid moves due to changes in **kinetic energy** of the particles in the fluid. The hotter regions in the fluid, the ones with more heat energy, have more \"excited\" particles that are colliding into one another more frequently. These regions are less **dense** than the colder regions. In the colder regions, the particles are colliding into one another less frequently therefore they do not spread out as much. Since there are less collisions, the particles are more concentrated in the colder region. These more dense and concentrated regions in the fluid are heavier since they have more particles in them. The cold, heavier regions will sink; allowing for the hotter regions to rise. Convection is the reason why \"heat rises\" in a room. \n", "\n", "---\n", "**Examples of convective processes**\n", "\n", "\n", "- In a pot filled with water on the stove, we observe convective heat transfer in the bubbles rising to the top of the pot. These are hotter, *lense dense* regions rising to the surface of the liquid. When these regions reach the point the that they are lense dense than the surrounding air, they will evaporate and undergo a transition of state from liquid to gas. \n", "\n", "<img src=\"images/pot_boiling.png\" width = \"400\" height = \"400\" style = \"border-radius: 8px;\">\n", "\n", "\n", "- In stars, there is a zone in which energy is transported from the core of the star, where energy is produced by nuclear fusion, to the surface. This is known as the *convective zone*. Due to the complicated nature of energy transportation within stars, this proces is difficult to model and the subject of ongoing research within the field of stellar astrophysics.

Clouds form as hotter air rises, carrying moisture with them. The air cools on its ascent, causing the moisture to condense. If the air is unstable enough, this process can occur for a longer time. This results in the formation of \"cumulonimbus clouds\", which are those very tall pillowy clouds that often produce thunder and lightning. Given enough moisture, instability in the air and convection (heat transfer), a thuderstorm is likely to occur. \n", "\n", "<img src = \"images/convectioninthunderstorms.jpg\" width = \"500\" height = \"500\" style = \"border-radius: 8px;\">\n", "\n", "---"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"hidden": false}, "source": ["## 3. Radiation\n", "\n", "Radiation is our third and final form of heat transfer to discuss. Heat transfer via radiation occurs in all matter that has a temperature above absolute 0 (0 Kelvin). It occurs from a conversion of thermal energy into *electromagnetic energy*. Energy is \"radiated\" away from a body in the form of \"light\". This light varies in wavelength and is dependent on the temperature of the body; hotter objects emit radiation at shorter wavelengths that carry higher energy. For example, in a fire, you may have heard how the blue part of a fire is hotter than the red part. This is true and is due to the fact that blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, and since the wavelength is dependent on the temperature of the material emmitting it, the blue portion of a fire is hotter. \n", "\n", "An interesting consequence of this fact comes from the analysis of the wavelengths of light radiated from the sun.
