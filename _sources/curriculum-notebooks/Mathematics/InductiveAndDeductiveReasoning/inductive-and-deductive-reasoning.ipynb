In fact, every multiplication algorithm you encounter will at some level boil down to some clever application of the distributive property. Simply put the distributive property tells us how addition and multiplication interact: $$(a+b)c = ac + bc.$$\n", "\n", "Since multiplication is commutative this statement is equivalent: $$a(c+d) = ac + ad.$$\n", "\n", "The FOIL mnemonic is just a special case of the distributive property:\n", "$$ (a+b)(c+d) = (a+b)c + (a+b)d = ac + bc + ad + bd. $$\n", "\n", "It is important to remember that the distributive property can be read two ways. In one sense it tells us how to distribute multiplication accross addition but in another sense it tells us how to undo that distribution.\n", "\n", "For an example, suppose you have something like $$6x + 10xy.$$\n", "If we notice that both $6x$ and $10xy$ have $2x$ as a factor, since $6x=2x(3)$ and $10xy=2x(5y)$, then we can rewrite that as $$6x + 10xy = 2x(3 + 5y).$$\n", "This technique is an extremely useful application of deductive reasoning. *Do not underestimate it.*"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### Mentally Computing Simple Percentages\n", "\n", "There are many occasions where one might be asked to compute a percentage of some value on the spot (eg. tipping at a restaurant).
