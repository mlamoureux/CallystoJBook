That length can't be treated the same way as the length it takes to go to the Moon from Earth. In other, 'mathier', words, we can't calculate long distances using the same methods we calculate small ones. Otherwise we'd get huge numbers for the long stuff, or tiny ones for the small stuff.\n",

    "So, humans came up with a way to solve this problem, and they created the **metric units**. These metric units help to calculate lengths. There are 7 of these units we need to focus on: **Kilometers**, **hectometers**, **decameters**, **meters**, **decimeters**, **centimeters**, and **millimeters**.\n",
