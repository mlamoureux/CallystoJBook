Equally as important, you gained some experience and exposure (if you haven't seen some already) to scientific computing. \n", "\n", "Additionally, we applied our methods within the context of solving transcendental equations. It is likely that this is the first time you have been exposed to transcendental equations and the methods we have discussed here. Hopefully, working through the notebook helped you understand the different ways in which one can break down a problem like this. Which did you like best? Being able to adapt and apply the mathematical tools that you have acquired in class is an invaluable skill to have. These skills often end up transferring to general problem-solving skills. I encourage you to reflect upon which of the methods you enjoyed and why. It will offer insight into your own personal learning process.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["[![Callysto.ca License](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/callysto-notebook-banner-bottom.jpg?raw=true)](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/LICENSE.md)"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.8"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
